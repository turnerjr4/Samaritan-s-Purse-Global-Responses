# Samaritans-Purse-Global-Responses
A map showing recent responses by Samaritan's Purse responses.

Intro: 
Samaratains Purse is a non-profit, Christian organization with roots in Boone, NC. They do humanitarian work around the world bringing much needed supplies, medical attention and other needed help to countries and communities experiencing hardship. I choose to do this project to help visualize the global responce capabilities of the organization around the world. Samaritains Purse has a large library of videos in which they document many of the responces they go on which provided a great data point for the map user to find out more information about specific places. By compiling point data and information about each response I was able to make an interactive visualization with multiple features helping the map user experience and understand more about where Samaratains Purse is opperating. 

Process: 
I gathered data from Samaratain's Purse (SP) website under the SP TV section (https://video.samaritanspurse.org/). After converting the data from cvs format into a geojson file I was able to imput that data onto a basemap. I choose icons for the different types of responces that SP conducts and assigned them each a unique color. I also choose what features would be present when clicking on a point and provided a link that would open in a new tab taking you to the SP website video made regarding the responce. I also provided a link for each type of responce which guides the map user to the main landing page regarding that specific responce type.

Challenges & design decisions:
The data in this map was time consuming to extract from the website. Without having internal access to SP data I had to manually provide datapoints and choose in some cases approximate locations within the Country mentioned in the video. Also the data points are only scratching the surface of what is available in the video library and I had to choose cut-off points for each responce due to time. I choose to go with a darker base map as it allowed the points to stand out a lot more. Also, when choosing the fonts and colors I was able to do some investigation through google resourses to find approximate colors and fonts used by SP logos.

Conclusion:
This map was interesting to me and allowed me to think in terms of what a client and map user would find useful and relavent. It also allowed me to practice refining the product with multiple drafts and coming back to it intermitently to help visualize the data. Looking forward I would like to revisit this map and potentially add all the data available and potentially put cluster features for SP content that has multiple video articals for the same regions.
